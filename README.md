#hs-silesia-template

Due to probable changes, I've added a huge buildtool just to make templating easier. 

Instructions:
* get node.js in version 0.10 or higher. It may be IO.js, but it probably won't work well at the moment (20.01.2015)
* Type `npm install` to install all required modules
* Install bower globally  `npm install bower -g`
* Type `bower install`
* Start gulp compile-watch by typing `npm start`
* Here you go, the site will be compiled in `deploy` directory!
